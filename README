# Enhanced Conversational AI System
Welcome to the Enhanced Conversational AI System - an advanced, learning-capable chatbot designed to mimic human conversational patterns with a focus on adaptability, context awareness, and emotional intelligence.

# Overview
This system integrates multiple AI components to create a conversational agent that goes beyond simple pattern matching. It features:

Dual Memory System: Simulates human-like memory with short-term and long-term memory capacities.
Transformer-Based Semantic Analysis: Uses pre-trained models for understanding text context.
Sentiment Analysis: Gauges emotional tones from user inputs for more empathetic responses.
Feedback System: Learns from user feedback to refine conversation patterns.
Adaptive Personality: Adjusts its conversational style based on interaction history.
Scenario Generator: For training and testing, generates complex conversation scenarios.

# Key Features
Memory Management
Short-Term Memory: Stores recent interactions for immediate context.
Long-Term Memory: Consolidates important interactions based on time and significance for long-term context retention.

# Advanced NLP
Transformer Encoder: Leverages BERT for text encoding, enabling semantic understanding of inputs.
Sentiment Analysis: Integrates sentiment scoring with keyword detection for nuanced emotion detection.

# Learning and Adaptability
Feedback Mechanism: Collects user feedback to adjust response patterns dynamically.
Personality Adaptation: Adjusts traits like empathy, curiosity, and formality based on user interaction.

# Scenario-Based Training
Scenario Generator: Creates varied conversation scenarios to train and test the AI under different conditions.
